# Automatic Branch Protection for New Repos

This repository stores the code on how to create branch protections for new repos and it will also mention the repo creator in an issue with the Branch protections created.

There are two versions of the code

1. [Local version](./Local_version)
  - Good to test locally, and quick
2. [AWS Lambda Function](./Lambda_code/)
  - More setup, secure and automated once setup with [GitHub webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads)

This repo will go over how to setup both of them.
